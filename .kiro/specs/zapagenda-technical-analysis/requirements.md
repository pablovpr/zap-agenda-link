## Introduction

ZapAgenda is a SaaS scheduling system designed for local businesses, featuring a dual-environment architecture with an administrative panel for merchants and public booking links for customers. The system enables businesses to manage their services, schedules, and appointments while providing customers with a seamless, login-free booking experience through unique slug-based URLs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying available slots THEN the system SHALL calculate availability in real-time considering business hours, professional schedules, and existing appointments
2. WHEN multiple customers access the same time slot simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prevent double-booking through proper concurrency control

4. IF the selected time slot becomes unavailable during booking THEN the system SHALL notify the customer and refresh available options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want secure access to my administrative panel, so that only I can manage my business settings and view appointments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customers access the public link THEN the page SHALL load within 2 seconds
2. WHEN displaying the booking interface THEN it SHALL maintain the current visual identity (colors, fonts, spacing, hierarchy)
3. WHEN showing available slots THEN the data SHALL be current and accurate
4. IF the page experiences high traffic THEN performance SHALL remain consistent through proper caching and optimization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a scalable infrastructure design, so that the system can handle growth in businesses and customers efficiently.
